## About

bootplate is a template for a minimal Enyo and Onyx web application.
You would normally use this to setup your local environment then go and modify the
files to build your own application.  By itself, it does almost nothing.

## Downloading

To download a version of bootplate with all of the submodules populated
for quick use, visit http://enyojs.com/get-enyo/.  The download link in GitHub will
give you just the bootplate repo without any of the supporting libraries.

As an alternative, you can use a Git client to clone this repo and then initialize
submodules. This is good if you want to work with the latest version of the code from
GitHub that we may not have packaged into an official release.

The `enyo` subfolder should be cloned from the enyo repo.
