## About

bootplate is a template for a minimal Enyo and Onyx web application.
You would normally use this to setup your local environment then go and modify the
files to build your own application.  By itself, it does almost nothing.

## Downloading

You can use a Git client to clone this repo and then initialize
submodules. Be aware that you'll need to clone recursively `--recurse-submodules`
to ensure that all the subfolders are downloaded.
